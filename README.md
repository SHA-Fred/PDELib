# PDELib

A free library for modeling systems described by 1D partial differential equations. (unlicensed)

## Library description

The PDE library offers blocks that can be used together with blocks of the Block library that forms part of the Modelica Standard Library for the implementation of distributed parameter models in one space dimension.

The numerical methods for solving partial differential equations currently implemented in the PDE library are the Method of Lines (MOL) and the Finite Volume Method (FVM).
